What is Programming?

Programming is the process of writing instructions that tell a computer what to do.

Computers cannot understand human languages like English or Marathi.
They understand only binary numbers (0 and 1).

To communicate with a computer, we use programming languages such as Python.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
It converts human-readable code into machine code using an interpreter.
