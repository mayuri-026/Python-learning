Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

you can use the print() function to display text or output values

If you want to print multiple words on the same line, you can use the end parameter:

Print Numbers:- You can also use the print() function to display numbers
You can also do math inside the print() function.

you can combine text and numbers in one output by separating them with a comma.

Python Comments:-- 

Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Comment = code madhla explanation text

Python comment execute kart nahi.
To fakta developer sathi explanation asto.
Comment = code madhla explanation text

# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

output - Hello, world!

Creating Variables--
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

Variable - Variables are containers for storing data values.

You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
x = 5
y = "Jony"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))


String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
x = "John"
print(x)
#double quotes are the same as single quotes:
x = 'John'
print(x)

Case-Sensitive
Variable names are case-sensitive.
a = 4
A = "techjar"

print(a)
print(A)

Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

Rules for Python variables:--

A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
